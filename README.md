R XGboost With Random Search for Hyperparameters

This file contains what I call a 'slug' for estimation of an XG Boost algorithm in R that uses random search to tune the various parameters. Be warned that it is very brute force; no effort is made to update hyperparameter distributions based on validation results. Moreover, no crossvalidation is performed. I view this slug as a way to develop priors about hyperparameter values so more elegant tuning may be performed.
